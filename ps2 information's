PS-2 focuses on designing a semi-active suspension controller for a vehicle.
The system is based on a quarter-car model, consisting of:
Sprung mass (vehicle body / cargo)
Unsprung mass (wheel assembly)
Only road displacement input is provided; all vehicle states must be computed through simulation.
The controller controls the damping coefficient c(t) in real time.
The damping value is constrained between Cmin and Cmax.
A 4 time-step actuator delay is included, making the problem more realistic.
The controller is allowed to use:
Sprung mass acceleration
Unsprung mass acceleration
Any causal internal memory (filters, buffers, etc.)
The main goal is to:
Reduce sprung mass displacement
Minimize jerk (rate of change of acceleration)
Improve ride comfort and cargo safety
Performance is evaluated on multiple road profiles.
Metrics used for evaluation include:
RMS displacement
Maximum displacement
RMS jerk
Comfort score
Final submission requires:
A CSV file with computed metrics
A report PDF with plots and explanation
The problem emphasizes control logic and system understanding, not machine learning.
